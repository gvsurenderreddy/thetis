SYNOPSIS

  require "pseudohash"

  record = PseudoHash.new.with_order ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlee']
  record['Charlee'] = 90
  record['Alice'] = 91
  record['Bob'] = 89
  record.each{|k,v|
    print "#{k}: #{v}; "
  }
  print "\n"

produces:
  Alice: 91; Bob: 89; Charlee 90;

DESCRIPTION

   PseudoHash is a subclass of Hash but can be specified the order of
   keys. The order of keys determines the order of the iterations of
   each.

METHODS

   phash[key, set = false] = val
          Stores val associating to key. If set is true and order does
          not include key, the key will be appended to order.

   order
          Returns the order of keys.

   order= array
          Sets the order of the keys to array.

   order_of key
          Returns the position of key in `order.

   with_oder array
          Similar to order= but returns self.

   each{|k,v| ....}
   each_pair{|k,v| ....}
          Iterates over all pairs of key and value in the order of
          `order'. The keys not included in `order' will be postponed.
